# Fitness-Tracker-Application

This application is made focusing on athletes who like to keep track of their progress
and train using their phones.
● Main aim is to develop a location-aware application which allows the user to test
themselves running to random nearby locations.
● This helps users to improve their overall fitness health by checking the progress as
all their runs are saved.
● Users are also given the feature of being able to reattempt previous runs to keep
track of their progress and may even delete runs that they feel were weak or are
unnecessary to easily find more important runs in their Past Runs pag
